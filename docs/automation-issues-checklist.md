## Quick Diagnostic Questions

### 1. **When you create a contract through your application:**
- Does the contract get saved to the database? ✅/❌
- Does the webhook get triggered? ✅/❌
- Does Make.com execute the scenario? ✅/❌
- Is a PDF generated? ✅/❌
- Is the PDF URL saved back to the database? ✅/❌

### 2. **In Make.com execution history:**
- Do you see executions when contracts are created? ✅/❌
- Are there any error messages? ✅/❌
- Do executions complete successfully? ✅/❌
- Are PDFs being generated? ✅/❌

### 3. **In your application logs:**
- Are there any error messages? ✅/❌
- Does the webhook call succeed? ✅/❌
- Is the PDF URL being returned? ✅/❌

## Common Automation Blockers

### 1. **Make.com Scenario Configuration**
- **Issue**: Scenario is paused or not configured for automatic execution
- **Solution**: Activate scenario and enable automatic execution

### 2. **Data Validation**
- **Issue**: Make.com scenario has required fields that are missing
- **Solution**: Update data structure or make fields optional

### 3. **Authentication**
- **Issue**: Google Docs API or other services require re-authentication
- **Solution**: Re-authenticate connections in Make.com

### 4. **Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Scenario fails on certain data and stops execution
- **Solution**: Add proper error handling and retry logic

### 5. **Timeout Issues**
- **Issue**: PDF generation takes longer than expected
- **Solution**: Increase timeout values or optimize scenario

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Run Comprehensive Test
\`\`\`bash
node scripts/debug-webhook-execution.js
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Check Make.com Execution History
1. Go to your Make.com scenario
2. Check "Execution history" tab
3. Look for recent executions
4. Check for error messages

### Step 3: Test Manual Execution
1. Click "Run once" on webhook trigger
2. See if it processes the data correctly
3. Check if PDF is generated

### Step 4: Check Application Logs
1. Look for webhook call logs
2. Check for database errors
3. Verify PDF URL updates

### Step 5: Test with Real Contract
1. Create a real contract through your application
2. Monitor the entire process
3. Identify where it fails
