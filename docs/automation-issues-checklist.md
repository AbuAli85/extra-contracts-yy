# Automation Issues Checklist

## What Does "Not Fully Automated" Mean?

Please check which of these issues you're experiencing:

### 🔄 **Webhook Trigger Issues**
- [ ] Webhook doesn't trigger automatically when contract is created
- [ ] Webhook triggers but scenario doesn't execute
- [ ] Webhook triggers but scenario fails to complete
- [ ] Webhook triggers but requires manual approval

### 📄 **PDF Generation Issues**
- [ ] PDF is not being generated at all
- [ ] PDF is generated but not returned to the application
- [ ] PDF URL is not being saved to the database
- [ ] PDF generation takes too long and times out

### 🗄️ **Database Issues**
- [ ] Contract is not being saved to database
- [ ] Contract is saved but PDF URL is missing
- [ ] Contract data is incomplete or incorrect
- [ ] Database errors occur during contract creation

### 🔐 **Authentication/Authorization Issues**
- [ ] Make.com scenario requires manual login
- [ ] Google Docs API authentication fails
- [ ] File upload permissions are missing
- [ ] API keys are expired or invalid

### ⏱️ **Timing Issues**
- [ ] Scenario takes too long to execute
- [ ] Application times out waiting for response
- [ ] Retry mechanism doesn't work properly
- [ ] Webhook response is delayed

### 📊 **Data Flow Issues**
- [ ] Data is not being passed correctly to Make.com
- [ ] Required fields are missing
- [ ] Data format is incorrect
- [ ] Arabic characters are not handled properly

## Quick Diagnostic Questions

### 1. **When you create a contract through your application:**
- Does the contract get saved to the database? ✅/❌
- Does the webhook get triggered? ✅/❌
- Does Make.com execute the scenario? ✅/❌
- Is a PDF generated? ✅/❌
- Is the PDF URL saved back to the database? ✅/❌

### 2. **In Make.com execution history:**
- Do you see executions when contracts are created? ✅/❌
- Are there any error messages? ✅/❌
- Do executions complete successfully? ✅/❌
- Are PDFs being generated? ✅/❌

### 3. **In your application logs:**
- Are there any error messages? ✅/❌
- Does the webhook call succeed? ✅/❌
- Is the PDF URL being returned? ✅/❌

## Common Automation Blockers

### 1. **Make.com Scenario Configuration**
- **Issue**: Scenario is paused or not configured for automatic execution
- **Solution**: Activate scenario and enable automatic execution

### 2. **Data Validation**
- **Issue**: Make.com scenario has required fields that are missing
- **Solution**: Update data structure or make fields optional

### 3. **Authentication**
- **Issue**: Google Docs API or other services require re-authentication
- **Solution**: Re-authenticate connections in Make.com

### 4. **Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Scenario fails on certain data and stops execution
- **Solution**: Add proper error handling and retry logic

### 5. **Timeout Issues**
- **Issue**: PDF generation takes longer than expected
- **Solution**: Increase timeout values or optimize scenario

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Run Comprehensive Test
\`\`\`bash
node scripts/debug-webhook-execution.js
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Check Make.com Execution History
1. Go to your Make.com scenario
2. Check "Execution history" tab
3. Look for recent executions
4. Check for error messages

### Step 3: Test Manual Execution
1. Click "Run once" on webhook trigger
2. See if it processes the data correctly
3. Check if PDF is generated

### Step 4: Check Application Logs
1. Look for webhook call logs
2. Check for database errors
3. Verify PDF URL updates

### Step 5: Test with Real Contract
1. Create a real contract through your application
2. Monitor the entire process
3. Identify where it fails

## Specific Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Webhook triggers but no PDF generated"
**Possible Causes:**
- Google Docs API authentication expired
- Template ID is incorrect
- Required fields missing in template
- File permissions issue

**Solutions:**
- Re-authenticate Google Docs connection
- Verify template ID and structure
- Check all required fields are provided
- Verify file permissions

### Issue: "PDF generated but not saved to database"
**Possible Causes:**
- Make.com doesn't return PDF URL
- Application doesn't handle response correctly
- Database update fails

**Solutions:**
- Configure Make.com to return PDF URL
- Check response handling in application
- Verify database update logic

### Issue: "Scenario executes but fails to complete"
**Possible Causes:**
- Missing required data
- API rate limits
- Network timeouts
- Authentication issues

**Solutions:**
- Add error handling in Make.com scenario
- Check all required data is provided
- Increase timeout values
- Re-authenticate connections

## Next Steps

1. **Run the debug script** to identify specific issues
2. **Check the checklist** above to pinpoint problems
3. **Review Make.com execution history** for error messages
4. **Test with real contract creation** to see the full flow
5. **Update configuration** based on findings

## Need More Help?

If you can't identify the specific issue:
1. Share the results of the debug script
2. Tell us which checklist items are failing
3. Share any error messages from Make.com or your application
