# ✅ PARTY ROLES SWAPPED SUCCESSFULLY

## Changes Applied

### 1. ✅ Webhook Backend Updated
**File:** `app/api/webhook/makecom/route.ts`

**Previous Assignment:**
- First Party = Client (type: 'Client')
- Second Party = Employer (type: 'Employer')

**New Assignment:**
- First Party = Employer (type: 'Employer') ✅
- Second Party = Client (type: 'Client') ✅

### 2. Database Party Types Now Correct
- `first_party_*` fields → Employer company
- `second_party_*` fields → Client company

## What This Means for Your Contracts

### Contract Structure Now:
```
FIRST PARTY (EMPLOYER):
Name: [Employer Company]
CRN: [Employer CRN]

SECOND PARTY (CLIENT):
Name: [Client Company] 
CRN: [Client CRN]

PROMOTER:
Name: [Promoter Name]
Working for the Employer to serve the Client
```

### Make.com Data Flow:
- `{{1.first_party_name_en}}` = Employer Company Name
- `{{1.first_party_name_ar}}` = Employer Company Name (Arabic)
- `{{1.first_party_crn}}` = Employer CRN
- `{{1.second_party_name_en}}` = Client Company Name
- `{{1.second_party_name_ar}}` = Client Company Name (Arabic)
- `{{1.second_party_crn}}` = Client CRN

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Update Google Docs Template (Optional)
If your template has labels, update them to reflect new roles:
- "First Party" → "First Party (Employer)"
- "Second Party" → "Second Party (Client)"

### 2. Test the Changes
1. Send a test webhook to Make.com
2. Verify the generated contract shows:
   - First Party as the Employer
   - Second Party as the Client
3. Check database records have correct party types

### 3. Verify Business Logic
Ensure this makes sense for your business:
- **Employer** hires promoter
- **Client** receives promotion services
- **Contract** defines the relationship

## Sample Input/Output

### Webhook Input:
```json
{
    "first_party_name_en": "ABC Marketing Agency",
    "second_party_name_en": "XYZ Electronics Store",
    "promoter_name_en": "John Doe"
}
```

### Generated Contract:
```
FIRST PARTY (EMPLOYER): ABC Marketing Agency
SECOND PARTY (CLIENT): XYZ Electronics Store
PROMOTER: John Doe (works for ABC to promote XYZ)
```

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE
The backend webhook has been updated to swap party roles as requested. The change is ready for testing!
